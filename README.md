## Overview

### *The Assignment*

The Module 19 Challenge gave us the task of creating a neural network that the HR department of a company could use to predict whether employees were likely to leave. Additionally, HR wanted to predict if some employees may be better suited for work in other departments. Our job was to create a branching neural network to make both of these predictions.

### *Written in*

Jupyter Notebook using Python v3.10.13, Pandas, scikit-learn, pathlib, and TensorFlow/Keras

### *Accessing the notebook*

To access the spam detector notebook, simply download the `.ipynb` file `attrition.ipynb` into a local directory, then load the `attrition.ipynb` file into Jupyter Notebook through your terminal.

## Execution

### *How to use*

Simply `Run All Cells` to execute the code in every cell of the notebook in sequence. Alternatively, each cell may be `Run` on its own, though it is still recommended to run them in order.

### *Breaking down the code*

Below is a more in-depth explanation of the various cells coded within the `attrition.ipynb` notebook.
